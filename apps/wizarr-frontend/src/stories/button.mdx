# Button

We use [FormKit](https://formkit.com/) to build our Button components, this makes creating buttons pretty easy. We have a few different types of buttons, but they can all be accessed through the `FormKit` component.

## Usage

```tsx
<FormKit type="button" label="Primary" data-theme="primary" />
```

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Stories

### Primary

A button can be of primary importance.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

A button can be of secondary importance.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
```
