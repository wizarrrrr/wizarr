# Architecture

Wizarr uses a traditional client-server design, with a dedicated database for data persistence. The frontend clients communicate with backend services over HTTP using REST APIs. Below is a high level diagram of the architecture.

## High Level Diagram

The diagram shows clients communicating with the server's API via REST. The server communicates with downstream systems (i.e. Redis, Postgres, file system) through repository interfaces.

## Clients

:::info
Our client uses [OpenAPI](./open-api.md) to auto-generate rest clients for easy integration. For more information about this process, see [OpenAPI](./open-api.md).
:::

### Web Client

The web app is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project that uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Server

The Wizarr backend is divided into several services, which are run as individual docker containers.

1. `wizarr-server` - Handle and respond to REST API requests and hosts the web client
2. `postgres` - Persistent data storage
3. `redis`- Queue management for `wizarr-server`

### Wizarr Server

The Wizarr Server is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project written for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). It uses the [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/) framework, with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) for database management. The server codebase also loosely follows the [MVP Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

#### REST Endpoints

The server is a list of HTTP endpoints and associated handlers (controllers). Each controller usually implements the following CRUD operations:

- `POST` `/<type>` - **Create**
- `GET` `/<type>` - **Read** (all)
- `GET` `/<type>/:id` - **Read** (by id)
- `PUT` `/<type>/:id` - **Updated** (by id)
- `DELETE` `/<type>/:id` - **Delete** (by id)

#### DTOs

The server uses [Domain Transfer Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) as public interfaces for the inputs (query, params, and body) and outputs (response) for each endpoint. DTOs translate to [OpenAPI](./open-api.md) schemas and control the generated code used by each client.

### Postgres

Wizarr persists data in Postgres, which includes information about access and authorization, users, settings, etc.

:::info
See [Database Migrations](./database-migrations.md) for more information about how to modify the database to create an index, modify a table, add a new column, etc.
:::

### Redis

Wizarr uses [Redis](https://redis.com/) via [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) to manage job queues. Some jobs trigger subsequent jobs.
