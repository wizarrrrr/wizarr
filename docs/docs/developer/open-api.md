# OpenAPI

Wizarr uses the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) standard to generate API documentation. To view the published docs see [here](/docs/api).

## Generator

OpenAPI is used to generate the client (Typescript) SDK. `openapi-generator-cli` can be installed [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/). The generated SDK is based on the `wizarr-openapi-specs.json` file, which is autogenerated by the server **when running in development mode**. When you add a new endpoint or modify an existing one, you must run the server in development mode to update the client SDK.

You can find the generated client SDK in the `open-api/typescript-sdk/client` for Typescript SDK.
