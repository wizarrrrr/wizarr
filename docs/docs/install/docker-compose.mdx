# Docker Compose [Recommended]

Docker Compose is the recommended method to run Wizarr in production. Below are the steps to deploy Wizarr with Docker Compose.

## Step 1 - Download the required files

Create a directory of your choice (e.g. `./wizarr`) to hold the `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files.

```bash title="Move to the directory you created"
mkdir ./wizarr
cd ./wizarr
```

Download [`docker-compose.yml`][compose-file] and [`example.env`][env-file] by running the following commands:

```bash title="Get docker-compose.yml file"
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://github.com/wizarrrrr/wizarr/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
```

```bash title="Get .env file"
wget -O .env https://github.com/wizarrrrr/wizarr/releases/latest/download/example.env
```

You can alternatively download these two files from your browser and move them to the directory that you created, in which case ensure that you rename `example.env` to `.env`.

## Step 2 - Populate the .env file with custom values

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Default environmental variable content">
    {ExampleEnv}
</CodeBlock>

- Populate `STORAGE_DIR` with your preferred location for storing data. It should be a new directory on the server or computer.
- Consider changing `DB_PASSWORD` to a custom value. Postgres is not publically exposed, so this password is only used for local authentication.
  To avoid issues with Docker parsing this value, it is best to use only the characters `A-Za-z0-9`. `pwgen` is a handy utility for this.
- Set your timezone by uncommenting the `TZ=` line.
- Populate custom database information if necessary.

## Step 3 - Start the containers

From the directory you created in Step 1 (which should now contain your customized `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files), run the following command to start Wizarr as a background service:

```bash title="Start the containers"
docker compose up -d
```

:::info Docker version
If you get an error such as `unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d` or `open <location of your .env file>: permission denied`, you are probably running the wrong Docker version. (This happens, for example, with the docker.io package in Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.) You can correct the problem by following the complete [Docker Engine install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) procedure for your distribution, crucially the "Uninstall old versions" and "Install using the apt/rpm repository" sections. These replace the distro's Docker packages with Docker's official ones.

Note that the correct command really is `docker compose`, not `docker-compose`. If you try the latter on vanilla Ubuntu 22.04, it will fail in a different way:

```
The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
'name' does not match any of the regexes: '^x-'
```

See the previous paragraph about installing from the official Docker repository.

:::info Health check start interval
If you get an error `can't set healthcheck.start_interval as feature require Docker Engine v25 or later`, it helps to comment out the line for `start_interval` in the `database` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Next Steps

Read the [Post Installation](/docs/install/post-install.mdx) steps or setup optional features below.

### Upgrading

:::danger Read the release notes
Wizarr is currently under heavy development, which means you can expect [breaking changes][breaking] and bugs. Therefore, we recommend reading the release notes prior to updating and to take special care when using automated tools like [Watchtower][watchtower].

You can see versions that had breaking changes [here][breaking].
:::

If `WIZARR_VERSION` is set, it will need to be updated to the latest or desired version.

When a new version of Wizarr is [released][releases], the application can be upgraded and restarted with the following commands, run in the directory with the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash title="Upgrade and restart Wizarr"
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

To clean up disk space, the old version's obsolete container images can be deleted with the following command:

```bash title="Clean up unused Docker images"
docker image prune
```
