# Support The Project

## Report issues

By far the easiest way to help make Wizarr better it to use it and report issues and bugs. Found a bug? [Open an issue on GitHub][github-issue].

## Translations

Support the project by localizing on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/wizarrrrr/wizarr). For more information, see the [Translations](/docs/developer/translations) section.

## Development

If you are a programmer or developer, take a look at Wizarr's [technology stack](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) and consider fixing bugs or building new features. The team and I are always looking for new contributors. For information about how to contribute as a developer, see the [Developer](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) section.

## Purchase Wizarr

You can also [purchase Wizarr](https://buy.wizarr.org), for either one user or your entire server. Building Wizarr takes a lot of time and effort, and we have full-time engineers working on it to make it as good as we possibly can, so any support is greatly appreciated.
