# Introduction

## Welcome!

I'm Ashley, a computer software developer from the United Kingdom, and I’m excited to share **Wizarr** with you. In mid-2023, I started working on a project called Wizarr. After taking over the project full-time, I decided to rebuild Wizarr from the ground up to create a more robust and scalable solution.

The first step in the rewrite was transforming the frontend from basic HTML and JavaScript into a full Vue3 Framework using TypeScript. This was the first half of the overhaul. The second half involved rewriting the backend from Python3 into NodeJS using TypeScript. With these changes, Wizarr has become a much more powerful and flexible tool.

Looking ahead, my vision for Wizarr is to expand it into a comprehensive management utility for server backends. I want it to be a single platform where you can manage users, control server functionality, monitor activity, and even sync databases across multiple servers— all from one unified dashboard.

I’ve always loved the open source community, and I’m proud to contribute to it with Wizarr. If you find the software useful or if it helps you in any way, please consider [supporting](./support-the-project.md) the project. Your support will help me continue to improve and maintain Wizarr for everyone.

Thanks for being part of this journey!
