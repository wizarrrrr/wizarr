  "description": "External libraries track assets stored in the filesystem outside of Wizarr. When the external library is scanned, Wizarr will load videos and photos from disk and create the corresponding assets. These assets will then be shown in the main timeline, and they will look and behave like any other asset, including viewing on the map, adding to albums, etc. Later, if a file is modified outside of Wizarr, you need to scan the library for the changes to show up.",
