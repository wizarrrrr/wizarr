  "description": "Users can deploy a custom reverse proxy that forwards requests to Wizarr. This way, the reverse proxy can handle TLS termination, load balancing, or other advanced features. All reverse proxies between Wizarr and the user must forward all headers and set the Host, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-For headers to their appropriate values. Additionally, your reverse proxy should allow for big enough uploads. By following these practices, you ensure that all custom reverse proxies are fully compatible with Wizarr.",
