This way, the reverse proxy can handle TLS termination, load balancing, or other advanced features. All reverse proxies between Wizarr and the user must forward all headers and set the Host, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-For headers to their appropriate values. Additionally, your reverse proxy should allow for big enough uploads. By following these practices, you ensure that all custom reverse proxies are fully compatible with Wizarr.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"administration/server-commands":{"id":"administration/server-commands","title":"Server Commands","description":"The immich-server docker image comes preinstalled with an administrative CLI (immich-admin) that supports the following commands:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"administration/server-stats":{"id":"administration/server-stats","title":"Server Stats","description":"Server statistics to show the total number of videos, photos, usage and quota per user.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"administration/storage-template":{"id":"administration/storage-template","title":"Storage Template","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"administration/system-integrity":{"id":"administration/system-integrity","title":"System Integrity","description":"Folder checks","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"administration/system-settings":{"id":"administration/system-settings","title":"System Settings","description":"The admin user can manage settings for the Wizarr instance here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"administration/user-management":{"id":"administration/user-management","title":"User Management","description":"Wizarr supports multiple users, each with their own library.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer/architecture":{"id":"developer/architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"Wizarr uses a traditional client-server design, with a dedicated database for data persistence.
